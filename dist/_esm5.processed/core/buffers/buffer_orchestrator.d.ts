 *
 *   - Push the right segments to those SourceBuffers depending on the user's
 *     preferences, the current position, the bandwidth, the decryption
 *     conditions...
 *
 *   - Concatenate Buffers for adaptation from separate Periods at the right
 *     time, to allow smooth transitions between periods.
 *
 *   - Emit various events to notify of its health and issues
 *
 * Here multiple buffers can be created at the same time to allow smooth
 * transitions between periods.
 * To do this, we dynamically create or destroy buffers as they are needed.
 * @param {Object} content
 * @param {Observable} clock$ - Emit position information
 * @param {Object} abrManager - Emit bitrate estimation and best Representation
 * to play.
 * @param {Object} sourceBuffersStore - Will be used to lazily create
 * SourceBuffer instances associated with the current content.
 * @param {Object} segmentPipelinesManager - Download segments
 * @param {Object} options
 * @returns {Observable}
