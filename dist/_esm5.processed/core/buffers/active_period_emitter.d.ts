 * Emit the active Period each times it changes.
 *
 * The active Period is the first Period (in chronological order) which has
 * a RepresentationBuffer associated for every defined BUFFER_TYPES.
 *
 * Emit null if no Period can be considered active currently.
 *
 * @example
 * For 4 BUFFER_TYPES: "AUDIO", "VIDEO", "TEXT" and "IMAGE":
 * ```
 *                     +-------------+
 *         Period 1    | Period 2    | Period 3
 * AUDIO   |=========| | |===      | |
 * VIDEO               | |=====    | |
 * TEXT    |(NO TEXT)| | |(NO TEXT)| | |====    |
 * IMAGE   |=========| | |=        | |
 *                     +-------------+
 *
 * The active Period here is Period 2 as Period 1 has no video
 * RepresentationBuffer.
 *
 * If we are missing a or multiple PeriodBuffers in the first chronological
 * Period, like that is the case here, it generally means that we are
 * currently switching between Periods.
 *
 * For here we are surely switching from Period 1 to Period 2 beginning by the
 * video PeriodBuffer. As every PeriodBuffer is ready for Period 2, we can
 * already inform that it is the current Period.
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Array.<string>} bufferTypes - Every buffer types in the content.
 * @param {Observable} addPeriodBuffer$ - Emit PeriodBuffer information when
 * one is added.
 * @param {Observable} removePeriodBuffer$ - Emit PeriodBuffer information when
 * one is removed.
 * @returns {Observable}
